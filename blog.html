               1: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const <br> <br>
               Var. <br>
               1. Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means that their scope is limited to the
               function in which they are declared, or the global scope if declared outside of any function. <br>
               2. Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their function or global scope. This means that
               regardless of where a var declaration appears within a function, it is effectively "moved" to the top of
               the function during execution.<br>
               3. var declarations can lead to unexpected behavior due to hoisting and the lack of block scope, which
               can cause variables to be accessible outside of their intended scope.


               let: <br><br>
               1. Variables declared with let are block-scoped. This means that their scope is limited to the block
               (enclosed by curly braces {}) in which they are declared. <br>
               2. let variables are not hoisted to the top of their block scope. They are only accessible after the
               point
               of declaration within their block. <br>
               3. Re-declaring the same variable with let within the same block scope will cause a syntax error.
               <br><br>


               Const. <br>
               1. Variables declared with const also have block scope like let. <br>
               2. const variables must be initialized with a value at the time of declaration, and once initialized,
               their value cannot be reassigned. <br>
               3. However, it's important to note that const does not make the variable immutable; it only prevents
               reassignment of the variable itself. If the variable holds an object or array, the properties or elements
               of that object or array can still be modified.

               2 : Tell us the use cases of null and undefined <br> <br>
               null:
               1. null is a value that represents the intentional absence of any object value or no value at all. <br>
               2. It can be used to explicitly indicate that a variable, property, or return value does not refer to any
               object. <br>
               3. Common use cases for null include: <br>
               Initializing variables or properties to indicate that they don't have a value yet. <br>
               4. Explicitly clearing or resetting values to indicate emptiness or lack of an object reference.

               undefined:
               1. undefined is a primitive value automatically assigned to variables or properties that have been
               declared
               2. but not initialized with a value. <br>
               It indicates the absence of a meaningful value, often unintentional or implicit. <br>
               3. Common use cases for undefined include:
               Variables or properties that have not been assigned a value. <br>
               4. Functions that don't return a value explicitly return undefined.

               3: What do you mean by REST API? <br><br>

               REST, which stands for Representational State Transfer, is an architectural style for designing networked
               applications. A RESTful API (Application Programming Interface) is an API that adheres to the principles
               of REST. Here's a breakdown of what this means:

               Representational State Transfer (REST):

               1. REST is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.
               It
               was first introduced by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000. <br>
               2. RESTful systems are based on a client-server model where clients can make requests to servers, and
               servers respond with representations of resources (such as JSON or XML). <br>
               3. REST relies on stateless communication, meaning each request from a client to a server must contain
               all
               the information necessary to understand and process the request, and each response from the server to the
               client contains all the information necessary to understand and process the response. This allows for
               scalability and reliability in distributed systems. <br>
               4. RESTful systems typically use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD (Create, Read,
               Update, Delete) operations on resources. <br>
               5. RESTful APIs emphasize the use of URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to identify resources and the
               use
               of hypermedia (such as links) to navigate between resources. <br> <br>
               RESTful API: <br><br>

               1. A RESTful API is an API that follows the principles of REST. This means it: <br>
               2. Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations. <br>
               3. Operates on resources, which are identified by URIs.
               Uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the result of a request (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found, 500
               Internal Server Error). <br>
               4. Uses hypermedia to enable clients to discover and navigate between resources. <br>
               5. RESTful APIs are commonly used for building web services that can be consumed by a wide variety of
               clients, including web browsers, mobile apps, and other servers. <br>
               6. They offer a standardized way of interacting with web-based resources, making it easier to develop,
               maintain, and integrate systems.
